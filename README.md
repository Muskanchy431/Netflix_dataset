Built using Excel, Power Query in Power BI, and Python,the project highlights practical skills in data preparation, visualization, storytelling.
# 🎬 Netflix Data Analytics Project

A complete end-to-end data analytics case study using Netflix's content dataset. 

 📌 **Project Overview**

In the age of streaming wars, Netflix stands as one of the dominant platforms in global entertainment. This project explores its content catalog — analyzing trends, genres, countries, content types, and more — through a series of steps that replicate a professional analytics workflow.

This repository includes:
- 🧼 A cleaned Excel dataset preprocessed for analysis  
- 🔧 A Power BI dashboard with interactive visuals using Power Query  
- 📊 A Python Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA)

 🧹** Data Cleaning Process**

The raw Netflix dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using 'Microsoft Excel and power query'and 'Power BI'. Key steps included:

- Handling missing and duplicate values
- Converting date fields into proper formats
- Splitting multi-value fields (e.g., genres, countries) into separate rows
- Standardizing text data for consistency
- Creating new calculated fields to enhance analysis

The result: a clean, structured Excel file (`"C:\Users\muskan chaudhary\Downloads\netflix_clean.xlsx"`) ready for in-depth analysis and dashboarding.

 📊 **Power BI Dashboard**

The Power BI report (`"C:\Users\muskan chaudhary\Downloads\NETFLIX dashboard.pbix.pbix"`) presents an interactive, business-ready dashboard built on the cleaned data. Key features include:

- 📅 Content added by year
- 🌍 Top 10 countries by content count
- 🎞️ Content type breakdown (Movies vs TV Shows)
- 🕒 Duration distribution
- 📈 Genre and rating analysis

Using Power Query, data transformations were handled directly within Power BI for a seamless, automated workflow.

 🧪 Python Exploratory Data Analysis

The `"C:\Users\muskan chaudhary\Downloads\netflix_dataset.ipynb"` notebook explores the dataset using:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visual exploration

This part of the project focuses on verifying data trends, identifying outliers, and supplementing dashboard insights through code.
